# covid19

## About
While there were plenty of Covid data sets available (this dash uses one of them), there wasn't much when it came to local data. 

I took it upon myself to pull together a data set for my state (Tasmania), sourced from the information that was available from the DHHS site, and Twitter.

As time went by, the data available through DHHS improved, so the need for my site subsided, but I've left it up.

## Where does the data come from?
The Department of [Health and Human Services](https://www.dhhs.tas.gov.au/news/2020) was the source for the Tasmanian data initially. Along sith daily numbers that were being published to twitter atthe time (whichever came first, but cross verified).
